# __SECOND_temp_REPO__firstTempHasBeenAbandoned-andNeedsToBeDeleted
When the "HELLO WORLD" tutorial has been successfully completed and all abandoned REPOs have been deleted, this temporary REPO will be migrated and become the permanent REPO for the camREBOOTER which runs on the SecuritySystemRPi





This here text (in this here "temporary REPO") is being written as instructed by the tutorial. This means that the tutorial is in progress. 

When the tutorial has been completed sucessfully: 
  1) delete all REPOs created during unsuccessful tutorial attempts (as mentioned above);
  2) use the "Migrate" option (and this here "temporary REPO") to create a new (permanent) REPO;
  3) update the SecuritySystemRPi to reflect this (new) VERSION of our (permanent) REPO ("camREBOOTER");
  4) delete this here "temporary REPO";
  5) make a "reference" or "notes" REPO that documents the material presented in the turorial.


(all the above text should probably be included with the notes to detail the whole process)
The following text should be included as/with the core documentation of the fundamentals learned:


  Any time a COMMIT has been MERGED into the MASTER, the code actively running on the SecuritySystemRPi must be updated as well.
  
  A COMMIT is produced by developing code in a BRANCH until such time as the MASTER & BRANCH together comprise the new updated VERSION of the REPO.
      After the coding is finalized, the next step is to SUBMIT A PULL REQUEST.
      After submission, there are then provisions (using [the] GIT [infrastructure]) for discussion. They could, for example, take the form of an oversight process, discover the need for additional code development/debugging, turn into: more testing -> modifications -> re-finalizing, or... etc.)
      `When all actions are confirmed and all discussions are resolved, the BRANCH gets MERGED into the MASTER and the latest VERSION of the REPO is born.
